# Setting Up Devpod CLI for DevContainer Usage

This comprehensive guide outlines the steps to seamlessly integrate Devpod CLI into your development workflow, allowing your team to efficiently utilize DevContainers. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup process.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Git:**
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Install Docker:**
   - Download and install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

3. **Install Visual Studio Code or Another Supported IDE:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code or any other IDE that supports DevContainers.

4. **Install Devpod UI and CLI:**
   - Obtain Devpod CLI and UI by following the installation instructions provided in the official documentation.

5. **Create SSH Keys for GitHub:**
   - Generate SSH keys using `ssh-keygen` and follow GitHub's guide to [add SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to your GitHub account.

## Setting Up DevContainers Locally

6. **Create a Sample DevContainer Configuration:**
   - In your project, create a `.devcontainer` folder and add a sample `devcontainer.json` file. Customize it based on your project's requirements.

7. **Compose Docker Files:**
   - Create the necessary Docker or Docker Compose files in your project to define the development environment.

8. **Configure Devpod to Access Local Credentials:**
   - Modify the DevContainer configuration to mount local credentials into the container. This ensures seamless integration with your local environment.

9. **Utilize CLI for Container Operations:**
   - Leverage Devpod CLI to start and manage containers. Use commands such as `devpod up` to create and launch DevContainers based on your configuration.

## Example DevContainer Configuration (devcontainer.json)

```json
{
  "name": "My DevContainer",
  "dockerComposeFile": ["docker-compose.yml"],
  "extensions": ["ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin"],
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
  },
  "mounts": [
    "source=/path/to/local/credentials,target=/credentials,type=bind"
  ]
}
